        <h2 class="reason-title">The "10 Minute Ban" That Became 10 Months</h2>
        <p class="reason-content">
          Riot said it would be 10 minutes. That was 300 days ago. Every time I check, the timer resets. 
          <span class="highlight ban-animation">My account is in digital purgatory</span> for crimes I don't remember committing.
        </p>
      </div>

        <div class="reason-number">2</div>
        <h2 class="reason-title">Three Games, Lifetime Ban</h2>
        <p class="reason-content">
          I played exactly three matches.  Now I'm treated like I ran a toxic behavior academy. 
          <span class="highlight">The learning curve is vertical, but the ban hammer is infinite</span>.

        <div class="reason-number">3</div>
        <h2 class="reason-title">The Vision That Shows You Nothing</h2>
        <p class="reason-content">
          You think you have vision until you realize you're alone in top lane while your team is fighting for dragon. 
          <span class="highlight">By the time you find the fight, you're already dead</span> and your teammates are pinging question marks on your corpse.

        <h2 class="reason-title">The Sudden "You Have Been Slain"</h2>
        <p class="reason-content">
          You feel powerful, watching all those health bars drop... until that voice says  
          <span class="highlight">"YOU HAVE BEEN SLAIN."</span>  
          That’s when you realize — it was your own health bar disappearing all along.

      <div class="reason">
        <div class="reason-number">5</div>
        <h2 class="reason-title">The Tutorial Was The Best Part</h2>
        <p class="reason-content">
          The tutorial made me feel powerful. Real matches made me feel like I was playing a different game. 
          <span class="highlight">I peaked at killing beginner bots</span>.

       <h2 class="reason-title">Champion Diff</h2>
      <p class="reason-content">
        You pick your champion, feeling confident — you mastered them in the tutorial, right?  
        Then you meet real players... and real champions.  
        <span class="highlight">Twice your height, ten times your damage — you get slain just by looking at them.</span>

      <div class="reason">
        <div class="reason-number">7</div>
        <h2 class="reason-title">The Eternal Queue</h2>
        <p class="reason-content">
          Waiting for my ban to lift feels like waiting for a ranked queue that never pops. 
          <span class="highlight">At this point, I'm pretty sure my account is a cautionary tale in Riot's headquarters</span>.

          Got bored? Went AFK for just 2 minutes?  
          <span class="highlight">HOW DARE YOU GO AFK IN LEAGUE?!</span>  
          BAM! You’ve unleashed pure chaos — they’re all mad now.

      <div class="reason">
        <div class="reason-number">9</div>
      <h2 class="reason-title">Infinite Match Round</h2>
      <p class="reason-content">
        You think it’s just a quick 30-minute game for fun... but NOOOO — three hours later, you’re still trying to end the same match.  
        <span class="highlight">And after it’s over, you’re too drained to do anything else.</span>
      </p>

      <div class="reason">
        <div class="reason-number">10</div>
        <h2 class="reason-title">Your finger? It’s getting biceps.</h2>
        <p class="reason-content">
          Unlike other games where you just use a controller or a few keyboard keys to move, League of Legends demands endless 
          <span class="highlight">MOUSE CLICKING</span>. Every step, every fight — click, click, click.
        </p>

   <div class="positive-section ">
      <h2 class="positive-title">Looking at the bright side?</h2>
      <p class="positive-content">
        Hard to believe a game this toxic can have such breathtaking cinematics. The sound, the music, the atmosphere — everything feels perfect… until you remember it’s League.
