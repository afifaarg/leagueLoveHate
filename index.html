              <p class="insight-card-text">
                It's not sudden at all. It's about spacing, farming, and item
                differences. When a higher-level champion enters your range,
                you're basically already dead if you're not prepared. It's not
                sudden—it's a calculated defeat.

                You don't have to prove yourself by jumping into intermediate
                mode. Playing against intro AI bots helps you master skills,
                movement, and game mechanics without the pressure. Take your
                time learning before facing real players.

                It's about choosing your battles wisely—knowing when to push and

                Going AFK ruins your teammates' experience. In bot lane, it

                loss. While I still find it harsh, I understand why the
